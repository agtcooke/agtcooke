# Tony's LSE README

Hi, this README is intended for my reports as a Lead Software Engineer.

**This file is continually updated (and perpetually incomplete).**

## Use

This is intended to help us have some shared understanding of how I roll, and how I expect we will interact with each other. It's not all-inclusive, but hopefully it covers a broad enough scope to help us be on the same page for a range of issues.

Feel free to suggest edits. I'm learning how to do this, so your feedback is **extremely** valuable.

## Operational

### Getting CPU Time

- I'm always here for you to talk to
- You don't have to schedule something; ignore my calander if needed
- 1:1 Flowdock messages are fine, but you might not have my full attention until I know you have something pressing

### 1:1's

- We will start with weekly (minus the checkpoint session), 1 hour sessions
- I am flexible to change this, but early in our relationship this is the default we will use
- This is _your_ time, and we can cover whatever topics you wish
- This does not have to be a status update session, but if you want to use it in that way, that's totally okay too
- If I have optional items to discuss, we can talk about those time permitting
- If I have non-optional items to discuss, and there isn't time in the 1:1, I will schedule something specifically for it
- I intend to take and share notes with you
- Since I'm remote, I will schedule a conference room for you
- If you do not like the conference room I schedule: let me know and I will accomodate the best I can

### Checkpoints

- Once per month, our 1:1 session will be replaced with checkpoints
- We'll discuss progress on your goals
- You should come prepared with items in the following categories, relevant to your goals:
   - What went well?
   - What could have gone better?
   - What next steps should we take to help you be successful?
- Any remaining time will be treated like a 1:1

## Known Issues

- I work off hours sometimes, coding or otherwise (administrative stuff). Always assume that I don't need a response until normal working hours, and even then without our normal communication frequency (I won't be expecting a response at 8AM on the nose).
